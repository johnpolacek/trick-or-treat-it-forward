        Like many families in 2020, we were trying to figure out what to do for
        Halloween. As cases are starting to rise in the fall, it didnâ€™t seem
        like a good idea to have batches of trick or treaters at our door. We
        could have done the candy bowl thing, but we wanted to do something a
        little more positive.

        It hit us. Instead of passing out candy, we could donate to those in
        need. It is a whole family project. My wife ordered some decorations.
        The boys helped with the art for a sign that will have a QR code that
        points to this little website I coded up.
